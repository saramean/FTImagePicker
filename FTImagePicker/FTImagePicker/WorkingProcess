Problems
- When the app enter the background and return to the foreground, in image picker, all the selected info is discarded by reload data method of collection view.
- When comming back from detail view, updated info is not reflected to the image picker (Cell doesn't refresh itself) if reload data called, all selected info is gone.
- When going and back to albumlist, initialize selections.
Idea. Use NSDictionary for saving selected images with its album name


To do List
- Play Live Photoes? in Detail View
